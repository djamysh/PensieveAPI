// Use Error.New(string) instead of custom error structure, it is cumbersome


// Consider improving the postman test scripts, after the latest edition they became a bit messy.

// Error handling is a serious issue now, for example now if I send a name that is duplicating
// returns 500 Internal however, it is actually only a Bad Request Status. This is important.
