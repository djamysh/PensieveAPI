// ! Debug the DeletePropertyHandler and DeleteProperty ,endpoint returns no content. 
	//event.Timestamp = int64(time.Now().Unix())
SOLVED: It is supposed to return STATUS NO CONTENT, I didn't know that.


// Use Error.New(string) instead of custom error structure, it is cumbersome

//!!! Always the Invalid data type error in create events request

// Mock functions seems fine, plug them into real functions however
// for PropertyValues structure change key field to PropertyID

// TODO: What happens if I update a property's ValueDataType or an activity's DefinedProperties ?
// Consider this, this is a real issue.
 

// Consider improving the postman test scripts, after the latest edition they became a bit messy.
// Write test scripts for delete requests in order to update ID arrays accordingly in Postman env.
