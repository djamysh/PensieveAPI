// ! Debug the DeletePropertyHandler and DeleteProperty ,endpoint returns no content. 
	//event.Timestamp = int64(time.Now().Unix())
SOLVED: It is supposed to return STATUS NO CONTENT, I didn't know that.


// Use Error.New(string) instead of custom error structure, it is cumbersome

//!!! Always the Invalid data type error in create events request

// Mock functions seems fine, plug them into real functions however
// for PropertyValues structure change key field to PropertyID
